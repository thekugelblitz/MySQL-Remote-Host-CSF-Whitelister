# MySQL Remote Host CSF Whitelister

A secure and performance-optimized shell script that automatically syncs MySQL remote host IPs with the CSF firewall on cPanel/WHM servers.

This script fetches all non-local MySQL user host IPs and hostnames that are added to cPanel MySQL Remote Host, excludes the server's own IPs and hostnames, and whitelists them using CSF‚Äîensuring seamless remote MySQL access without manual firewall entries and edits. The script, with cronjob, automatically adds new IP addresses to CSF (ConfigServer Firewall) when a cPanel user adds them to their cPanel MySQL Remote Host. It's super easy and time-saving!

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Fully automated CSF whitelisting for remote MySQL hosts
- üö´ Skips localhost, private ranges, and server-owned IPs
- üõ† Efficient (non-looping), clean, and secure execution
- üìÑ Dry-run mode for safe validation
- üìù Logs all actions and warnings/errors separately

## üì• Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thekugelblitz/MySQL-Remote-Host-CSF-Whitelister/main/install_mysql_csf_whitelist_v2.sh -O install_mysql_csf_whitelist_v2.sh
chmod +x install_mysql_csf_whitelist_v2.sh
./install_mysql_csf_whitelist_v2.sh
```


---

## ‚è± Cron Setup

Run the script automatically every 1 minute or as per your need, like 15 minutes:

`* * * * * /bin/bash /root/mysql_csf_whitelist.sh >> /var/log/mysql_csf_cron.log 2>&1`

For debugging/testing:

`*/1 * * * * /bin/bash /root/mysql_csf_whitelist.sh --dry-run >> /var/log/mysql_csf_cron_test.log 2>&1`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### ‚û§ Run Manually

`
./mysql_csf_whitelist.sh
`

### ‚û§ Dry Run

`
./mysql_csf_whitelist.sh --dry-run
`

This will show all the IPs it would whitelist without making any changes.

### üîÅ Delisting Mechanism

This script not only **adds** valid remote MySQL IPs to CSF, but it also includes an **automated delisting system** to keep your firewall clean and up-to-date.

#### ‚úÖ How it Works:
- Every minute, the script checks all IPs currently allowed in CSF that were tagged by the script:  
  `# Auto-whitelist:mysql`
- If an IP is no longer found in the MySQL remote host entries (`mysql.user` table), it is automatically **removed** from CSF using:
  ```bash
  csf -ar <IP>
  ```
- This ensures only **actively used** and **valid** remote MySQL hosts stay whitelisted.

#### üß™ Example:
If your `/etc/csf/csf.allow` contains:
```
116.203.XX.XX # Auto-whitelist:mysql
```
...but that IP is removed from MySQL remote access, it will be:
- **Identified as stale**
- **Removed from CSF automatically**

#### üîê Safe & Clean:
- Only entries that were originally added by the script (`Auto-whitelist:mysql`) will be removed.
- No other CSF entries are touched.

## üìÇ Logs

- ‚úÖ Main Log: /var/log/mysql_csf_cron.log
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error/Skip Log: /var/log/mysql_csf_whitelist_error.log

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example MySQL Output Handled

CSF Output:

`
csf.allow: 45.11.XX.XX # Auto-whitelist:mysql:2025-04-08 - Tue Apr  8 03:21:20 2025
`

Default MySQL fetch query:

```
mysql> SELECT Host, User FROM mysql.user WHERE Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
+--------------+--------------------+
| Host         | User               |
+--------------+--------------------+
| 103.99.XX.XX | example_remote     |
| 192.168.1.10 | bad_entry          |
| server.host  | should_be_skipped  |
| 45.11.XX.XX  | good_ip            |
+--------------+--------------------+
```

This script will **only allow valid public IPs or hostnames**, not local/private ones.
