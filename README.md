# MySQL Remote Host CSF Whitelister

A secure and performance-optimized shell script that automatically syncs MySQL remote host IPs with the CSF firewall on cPanel/WHM servers.

This script fetches all non-local MySQL user host IPs and hostnames that are added to cPanel MySQL Remote Host, excludes the server's own IPs and hostnames, and whitelists them using CSF‚Äîensuring seamless remote MySQL access without manual firewall entries and edits. The script, with cronjob, automatically adds new IP addresses to CSF (ConfigServer Firewall) when a cPanel user adds them to their cPanel MySQL Remote Host. It's super easy and time-saving!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example MySQL Output Handled

CSF Output:

`
csf.allow: 45.11.XX.XX # Auto-whitelist:mysql:2025-04-08 - Tue Apr  8 03:21:20 2025
`

Default MySQL fetch query:

```
mysql> SELECT Host, User FROM mysql.user WHERE Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
+--------------+--------------------+
| Host         | User               |
+--------------+--------------------+
| 103.99.XX.XX | example_remote     |
| 192.168.1.10 | bad_entry          |
| server.host  | should_be_skipped  |
| 45.11.XX.XX  | good_ip            |
+--------------+--------------------+
```

This script will **only allow valid public IPs or hostnames**, not local/private ones.
